# MYDNS-Intermediate-Coding
This is the final project done for the MYDNS Intermediate Level Coding course conducted by the government's youth development programme. 

This website was done entirely in html, css and php as instructed by the teacher.

ABOUT THE PROJECT

Design and create a simple online Web-based Voting System for the best restaurant in Trinidad and 
Tobago. 
You will work on this program throughout the course and update it with features taught in every 
session. 
SCOPE 

The Final Web-Based Application should have the following: 
- A Welcome page containing links to register, vote and view results. (5 marks) 
- The registration page should ask for the userâ€™s first name, last name, e-mail address and 
password. Data captured should be validated. (20 marks) 
- The voting page should list at least five (5) restaurants from which the user can ONLY vote 
for one. (10 marks) 
- For a vote to be counted the user must enter their correct username and password. This 
can be implemented by introducing an additional field for username or you can utilise the 
e-mail for this. (25 marks) 
- Data should be stored using a MYSQL database. Hint: You can use separate tables to store 
the votes for each restaurant. (25 marks)
Marks will be allocated for layout and flow. (15 marks)
